Camal Case

Time complexity: O(n) This is because the code only interrogates through the whole list once 


Space Complexity O(1) Because it only takes in the space from the data types that we have, which is only char and int


Correctness and the Loop Invariant

Time complexity: O(Logn)= it would be this time complexity because it uses a while loop

Space complexity: The space complexity of this would be O(1) because we only use one data type which is int
