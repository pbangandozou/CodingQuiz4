I could not find the bug however,

when coding I realized that it was always the zero index that did not get organized 

But i belive the bug in the code was from     static void printArray(int[] ar) {
        for(int n: ar){
            System.out.print(n +" ");
        }
    }
When trying to figure out what to do I added one to the code to see if maybe it was because it was going starigt to the next index

However I think that the math and the process is correct I just belive that it was when the code was printing that is where it went wrong, 
because i got the 4 to move but then the 5 was in the wrong spot
